# Executo

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/executo`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'executo'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install executo

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

Run worker using `sidekiq -r ./boot.rb -C sidekiq.yml`
Run active-job worker using `sidekiq -r ./boot_activejob.rb`

Publish jobs using:
```ruby
Executo.publish('localhost', 'ls', ['-al'])
```

You can publish jobs encrypted as well, which means that the command and parameters, but also passed options are encrypted before sent to the server (sidekiq/redis).
They are only decrypted in memory for the command te be executed. Job options are never encrypted.
This is ideal if you don't want email addresses or passwords to be littered over log files or in the redis database.

Publish encrypted jobs using:
```ruby
Executo.publish('localhost', 'ls', ['-al'], encrypt: true)
```
